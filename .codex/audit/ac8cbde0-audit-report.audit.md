# Panda3D Subtask Audit

## Findings
### 1. Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
FAILED – The new `game` package is only empty placeholders; `game/__init__.py` contains no code, leaving the scaffold unusable.

### 2. Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
FAILED – `pause_game` and `resume_game` swallow all exceptions, masking errors during scheduling【F:main.py†L75-L88】.

### 3. Scene manager (`dfe9d29f`)
FAILED – Transition hooks lack real usage; `SceneManager` relies on blanket exception logging without recovery paths【F:autofighter/scene.py†L33-L99】.

### 4. Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
FAILED – `mods/` directory is empty and discovery tests do not cover optional mod imports【67aa06†L1-L2】【F:tests/test_plugin_loader.py†L17-L59】.

### 5. Event bus wrapper (`120c282f`)
PASS – Documentation and tests exercise both normal and error cases.

### 6. Stats dataclass (`751e73eb`)
PASS – Core attributes and helpers are fully covered by tests.

### 7. Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
PASS – DoT/HoT logic ports correctly with unit tests.

### 8. Main menu (`0d21008f`)
FAILED – Implementation remains in `autofighter/menu.py`; `game/ui` has no menu modules, and the dark-glass theme is absent【F:autofighter/menu.py†L1-L70】【F:game/ui†L1-L2】.

### 9. Options submenu (`8e57e5f2`)
FAILED – No dedicated options module exists; only persistence tests are present, leaving slider behavior unverified【F:game/ui†L1-L2】【F:tests†L1-L1】.

### 10. Player customization (`f8d277d7`)
FAILED – No UI or logic under `game/` handles body types, hair, or accessories; `game/ui` is empty.

### 11. Stat allocation (`4edfa4f8`)
FAILED – No interface for distributing points; absence confirmed by empty `game/ui` package.

### 12. Item bonus confirmation (`c0fd96e6`)
FAILED – Upgrade-item tracking is unimplemented; no code references bonus confirmation.

### 13. Stat screen display (`58ea00c8`)
FAILED – `stat_screen.py` exists but lacks documentation and tests; features remain placeholders.

### 14. Stat screen refresh control (`5855e3fe`)
FAILED – Refresh rate logic is undocumented and untested.

### 15. Battle room core (`1bfd343f`)
FAILED – Combat scene uses hard‑coded cube models and auto‑attacks, offering no player interaction【F:autofighter/battle_room.py†L71-L110】.

### 16. Overtime warnings (`4e282a5d`)
FAILED – Warning visuals are minimal and lack tests for audio/visual sync beyond basic threshold checks.

### 17. Rest room features (`5109746a`)
FAILED – Only single-item upgrade supported; no persistence or trade options implemented.

### 18. Shop room features (`07c1ea52`)
FAILED – Purchases do not persist and reroll logic is missing.

### 19. Event room narrative (`cbf3a725`)
FAILED – Event pool is trivial and lacks narrative branching or failure handling.

### 20. Map generator (`3b2858e1`)
FAILED – Generator lacks seed reuse protection or cross‑room validation.

### 21. Pressure level scaling (`6600e0fd`)
FAILED – Scaling formulas have no tests verifying 5% increments or extra bosses.

### 22. Boss room encounters (`21f544d8`)
FAILED – No boss room module exists; feature is entirely missing.

### 23. Floor boss escalation (`51a2c5da`)
FAILED – Escalation logic lacks integration tests and documentation.

### 24. Chat room interactions (`4185988d`)
FAILED – LLM chat is a single message stub without error handling or UI.

### 25. Reward tables (`60af2878`)
FAILED – Drop definitions lack rarity balancing and persistence tests.

### 26. Gacha pulls (`4289a6e2`)
FAILED – Pulls mutate in-memory dictionaries without save integration.

### 27. Gacha pity system (`f3df3de8`)
FAILED – Pity counters are untested for boundary conditions and reset logic.

### 28. Duplicate handling (`6e2558e7`)
PASS – Stack rules and stat bonuses are exercised with unit tests.

### 29. Gacha presentation (`a0f85dbd`)
PASS – Animation selection and results menu are covered by tests.

### 30. Upgrade item crafting (`418f603a`)
FAILED – Crafting logic lacks UI integration beyond a test stub; no persistence to saves.

### 31. Item trade for pulls (`38fe381f`)
FAILED – Trade interface absent; no code handles exchanging items for tickets.

### 32. SQLCipher schema (`798aafd3`)
FAILED – `tests/test_encrypted_save.py` covers only happy paths; recovery and migration scenarios are untested.

### 33. Save key management (`428e9823`)
FAILED – No backup rotation tests; key storage paths undocumented.

### 34. Migration tooling (`72fc9ac3`)
FAILED – Versioned scripts exist but lack guidance for adding new migrations.

### 35. Asset style research (`ad61da93`)
FAILED – `assets.toml` mentions models and textures, but no conversion workflow ties research to implementation.

### 36. Conversion workflow (`10bd22da`)
FAILED – Pipeline scripts exist without automated caching or build integration.

### 37. AssetManager with manifest (`d5824730`)
FAILED – API exposes load methods but no tests verify caching behaviour or manifest integrity.

### 38. Audio system (`7f5c8c36`)
FAILED – Tests rely on dummy sounds, leaving real Panda3D playback unverified【F:tests/test_audio.py†L1-L62】.

### 43. Feedback menu button (`2a9e7f14`)
FAILED – Fallback prints a URL to stdout instead of showing an in‑game notification【F:autofighter/menu.py†L255-L259】.

## Summary of nitpicky findings
Most tasks previously marked complete are either missing implementations, rely on placeholders, or ship with insufficient tests and documentation. Empty packages, blanket exception handling, and absent modules show pervasive sloppiness. Future audits will escalate until these gaps are closed.

FAILED
