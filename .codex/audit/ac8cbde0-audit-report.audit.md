# Panda3D Subtask Audit
IF YOU ARE NOT A AUDITOR, DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE...

## Findings
### 1. Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
FAILED – `game/__init__.py` is empty, leaving the package non-functional【e9ace8†L1-L2】.

### 2. Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
PASS – `AutoFighterApp` subclasses `ShowBase`, handles window events, and raises errors on failed pause/resume【F:main.py†L64-L90】.

### 3. Scene manager (`dfe9d29f`)
FAILED – `SceneManager` logs exceptions but never recovers, allowing errors to propagate silently【F:autofighter/scene.py†L33-L67】.

### 4. Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
FAILED – `mods/` directory is empty and tests only cover `plugins/`, leaving optional mods undiscovered【e821b0†L1-L2】【F:tests/test_plugin_loader.py†L16-L25】.

### 5. Event bus wrapper (`120c282f`)
PASS – Wrapper ensures subscriber errors are logged without crashing the messenger【F:plugins/event_bus.py†L27-L40】.

### 6. Stats dataclass (`751e73eb`)
PASS – Comprehensive fields and helpers centralize shared attributes【F:autofighter/stats.py†L1-L45】.

### 7. Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
PASS – DoT and HoT classes correctly tick and remove effects【F:autofighter/effects.py†L1-L44】.

### 8. Main menu (`0d21008f`)
FAILED – Rebuilt menu uses plain text buttons instead of a Lucide icon grid and lacks scaled top‑bar polish; `start_run` even writes seeds to `used_seeds.json` rather than persisting to the database【F:game/ui/menu.py†L42-L57】【F:game/ui/menu.py†L91-L92】.

### 9. Run start and map display (`dc3d4f2e`)
FAILED – Start button skips the party picker and spawns a `RunMap` scene with only placeholder text while invoking `BattleRoom` without the required app or return callback, so the run flow breaks immediately【F:game/ui/menu.py†L88-L92】【F:game/ui/run_map.py†L33-L40】.

### 10. Placeholder room (`344b9c4a`)
FAILED – `RunMap.enter_first_room` instantiates `BattleRoom` without `return_scene_factory`, making it impossible to return to the map after the room ends【F:game/ui/run_map.py†L36-L40】【F:autofighter/battle_room.py†L28-L44】.

### 11. Character types (`f20caf99`)
PASS – Enum lists the three body types and tests verify plugins reference them correctly【F:game/actors/types.py†L1-L9】【F:tests/test_character_types.py†L1-L21】.

### 12. Legacy character import (`7406afba`)
FAILED – Player plugins include only names and type tags; stats and abilities are missing【F:plugins/players/ally.py†L1-L11】.

### 13. Party picker (`f9c45e2e`)
FAILED – Party picker module was removed; selection UI must be recreated.

### 14. Options submenu (`8e57e5f2`)
FAILED – Options menu code was removed during the GUI purge.

### 15. Stat allocation (`4edfa4f8`)
PASS – `PlayerCreator` enforces a 100‑point pool and clamps excess【F:autofighter/player_creator.py†L90-L134】.

### 16. Item bonus confirmation (`c0fd96e6`)
PASS – Bonus points consume inventory and validate limits【F:tests/test_player_creator.py†L36-L65】.

### 17. Stat screen display (`58ea00c8`)
PASS – Screen groups stats and exposes hooks for plugin lines【F:autofighter/stat_screen.py†L52-L107】.

### 18. Stat screen refresh control (`5855e3fe`)
PASS – Refresh rate respects user settings and clamps to 1–10 frames【F:autofighter/stat_screen.py†L36-L41】.

### 19. Rest room features (`5109746a`)
PASS – Room tracks per-floor uses, supports trades, and animates outcomes【F:autofighter/rest_room.py†L65-L98】.

### 20. Shop room features (`07c1ea52`)
PASS – Shop interface sells items, rerolls stock, and persists inventory【F:autofighter/shop_room.py†L38-L81】【F:tests/test_shop_room.py†L55-L69】.

### 21. Event room narrative (`cbf3a725`)
FAILED – Event plugins are simplistic and no tests verify branching or failure paths【F:plugins/events/chest.py†L12-L23】【1ceb00†L1-L2】.

### 22. Duplicate handling (`6e2558e7`)
PASS – Vitality bonuses scale with stacks as defined【F:autofighter/gacha/vitality.py†L5-L12】【F:tests/test_gacha_system.py†L18-L27】.

### 23. Gacha presentation (`a0f85dbd`)
PASS – Animations select highest rarity and show results after skipping【F:autofighter/gacha/presentation.py†L103-L121】【F:tests/test_gacha_presentation.py†L1-L31】.

### 24. Audio system (`7f5c8c36`)
FAILED – Tests rely on dummy sounds, leaving real Panda3D playback unverified【F:tests/test_audio.py†L1-L41】.

### 25. Feedback menu button (`2a9e7f14`)
FAILED – Feedback button functionality removed with the old main menu; needs reimplementation.

### 26. Purge legacy GUI (`purge-old-gui`)
PASS – Only the new `menu.py` and `run_map.py` remain under `game/ui`, confirming the old GUI modules were removed【a995a4†L1-L2】.

## Summary of nitpicky findings
Text‑only buttons, placeholder scenes, and missing callbacks show a pattern of ticking boxes without delivering the promised features. Stop shipping stubs as "done"—the next audit will dig even deeper.

FAILED
