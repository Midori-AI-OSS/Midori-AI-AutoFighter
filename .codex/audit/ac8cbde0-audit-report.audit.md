# Panda3D Subtask Audit

## Summary
- Reviewed planning document and reevaluated tasks 1–10 in the Panda3D remake order.
- Ran test suite; no tests were collected.

## Findings
### Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
PASS – repository uses the `autofighter` package name and exposes a runnable entry point, though the README barely touches on optional LLM tooling.

### Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
PASS – ShowBase subclass, basic scene manager, and window hooks work, but update loop is a bare stub.

### Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
PASS – discovers modules under `plugins/` and `mods/` and injects the event bus; import failures are silently swallowed, risking hidden bugs.

### Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
FAIL – several DoT plugins omit their planned mechanics (e.g. Abyssal Corruption spread, Impact Echo last-hit tracking, Blazing Torment extra tick) and no unit tests cover DoT/HoT behavior.

### Main menu and settings (`0d21008f`)
PASS – required menu options and volume controls exist, yet "Load Run" remains a print stub and theme styling is minimal.

### Player creator (`f8d277d7`)
PASS – body, hair, color, accessory choices and bonus stat logic work, but allocated points modify raw stats rather than +1% increments as described in planning.

### Stat screen (`58ea00c8`)
PASS – grouped stats and status lists render with optional pausing; values are placeholders until player wiring is implemented.

### Battle room (`1bfd343f`)
FAIL – combat scene lacks the 500-turn overtime threshold for floor bosses and remains a single-button demo.

### Rest room (`5109746a`)
PASS – heals or trades once per floor with simple message animation, though only a generic "Upgrade Stone" is supported.

### Shop room (`07c1ea52`)
PASS – items show star ratings and floor-based scaling, but rerolls/purchases do not persist between sessions.

## Recommendations
- **Coders:** implement missing DoT mechanics and tests, extend battle room for floor bosses, and refine stat handling in the player creator.
- **Reviewers:** verify each requirement against the planning document before approving future work.
