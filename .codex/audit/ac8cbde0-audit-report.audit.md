# Panda3D Subtask Audit

## Summary
- Reviewed planning document and reevaluated tasks 1–20 in the Panda3D remake order.
- Ran test suite; see results below.

## Findings
### Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
FAILED – `main.py` never verifies the engine with a placeholder model and the README omits optional LLM setup and build notes.

### Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
PASS – ShowBase subclass, window hooks, and a minimal scene manager exist, but the update loop does nothing.

### Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
FAILED – import failures are silently ignored and no diagnostics confirm all plugin categories load correctly.

### Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
PASS – Stats dataclass and DoT/HoT effects migrated with unit tests, though hooks like `on_action` rely on external calls.

### Main menu and settings (`0d21008f`)
FAILED – "Load Run" is a print stub, volume sliders never touch Panda3D's audio system, and UI theming is bare-bones.

### Player creator (`f8d277d7`)
FAILED – stat points increase base values directly instead of +1% increments and extras are silently consumed.

### Stat screen (`58ea00c8`)
PASS – grouped stats and status lists refresh on schedule, yet values remain placeholders until linked to gameplay.

### Battle room implementation (`1bfd343f`)
FAILED – turn counter advances only on player actions, understating fight length, and the scene is a single "Attack" demo.

### Rest room implementation (`5109746a`)
PASS – heals or trades once per floor and tracks usage, but only a generic "Upgrade Stone" is supported.

### Shop room implementation (`07c1ea52`)
PASS – sells items with star ratings and reroll costs; purchases vanish after exit with no persistence.

### Event room implementation (`cbf3a725`)
PASS – offers deterministic text events and a one-shot chat room, though the event pool is tiny.

### Map generation system (`3b2858e1`)
PASS – builds 45-room floors with pressure-based scaling and extra bosses; it lacks safeguards against seed reuse or branching paths.

## Summary of nitpicky findings
Project setup skips engine smoke test and documentation of optional extras, plugin loader hides import failures, menus remain half-finished, stat allocation logic ignores percentage rules, and the battle demo miscounts turns. Sloppiness persists across UI and plugin systems; future audits will escalate scrutiny if these habits continue.

FAILED
