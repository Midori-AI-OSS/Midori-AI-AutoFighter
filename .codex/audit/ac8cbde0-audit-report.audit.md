## Summary of nitpicky findings
Placeholders masquerading as finished features (main menu, legacy characters, audio) betray a sloppy completion mindset. Empty packages, missing stats, and fake assets show a habit of checking boxes without delivering quality. Expect far harsher scrutiny next time unless these gaps vanish.

FAILED
