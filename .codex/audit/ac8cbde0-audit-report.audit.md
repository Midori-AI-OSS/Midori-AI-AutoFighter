# Panda3D Subtask Audit

## Summary
- Reviewed planning document and audited tasks 1–38 in the Panda3D remake order.
- Ran test suite; see results below.

## Findings
### Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
PASS – `main.py` loads a placeholder model verifying Panda3D and `README.md` documents optional LLM extras.

### Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
PASS – `AutoFighterApp` handles window events; the update loop is still a no-op.

### Scene manager (`dfe9d29f`)
PASS – scene swapping and overlay stacking work, though there’s no error logging.

### Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
PASS – discovers plugins, raises on import failures, and enforces required categories.

### Event bus wrapper (`120c282f`)
PASS – wraps Panda3D’s messenger with error logging for subscriber callbacks.

### Stats dataclass (`751e73eb`)
PASS – central stats container with damage/healing helpers.

### Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
PASS – `EffectManager` ticks DoT/HoT effects; `on_action` hooks rely on external calls.

### Main menu (`0d21008f`)
PASS – New Run, Load Run, Edit Player, Options, and Quit are wired up; theme remains plain.

### Options submenu (`8e57e5f2`)
PASS – sliders adjust audio volumes and stat refresh rate; pause toggle syncs with the app.

### Player customization (`f8d277d7`)
PASS – body, hair, color, and accessory options with stat sliders and upgrade-item bonuses.

### Stat allocation (`4edfa4f8`)
PASS – 100-point pool applies +1% increments per stat.

### Item bonus confirmation (`c0fd96e6`)
PASS – extra-point cost is deducted from inventory before saving.

### Stat screen display (`58ea00c8`)
PASS – grouped stats and status lists render, though values are placeholders until gameplay links in.

### Stat screen refresh control (`5855e3fe`)
PASS – background task honors user-defined refresh intervals.

### Battle room core (`1bfd343f`)
PASS – auto-rounds with stat-driven accuracy and overtime hooks; subclasses assume nonexistent UI elements.

### Overtime warnings (`4e282a5d`)
PASS – room flashes red/blue and applies an Enraged buff after threshold.

### Rest room features (`5109746a`)
PASS – one heal or trade per floor tracked; only an “Upgrade Stone” is supported.

### Shop room features (`07c1ea52`)
PASS – sells items with star ratings and reroll cost; purchases lack persistence.

### Event room narrative (`cbf3a725`)
PASS – deterministic outcomes via seeded events; event pool is tiny.

### Map generator (`3b2858e1`)
PASS – builds 45-room floors with pressure-based scaling; no protection against seed reuse.

### Pressure level scaling (`6600e0fd`)
PASS – stats scale 5% per level and extra rooms/bosses are added.

### Boss room encounters (`21f544d8`)
FAILED – `foe_attack` references `self.attack_button`, which `BattleRoom` never defines, causing runtime errors.

### Floor boss escalation (`51a2c5da`)
PASS – loop-aware scaling multiplies stats and rewards.

### Chat room interactions (`4185988d`)
PASS – one-message LLM chats with per-floor limits.

### Reward tables (`60af2878`)
PASS – `WeightedPool` defines drops for normal, boss, and floor boss fights.

### Gacha pulls (`4289a6e2`)
PASS – pulls consume tickets, craft upgrades, and trade items.

### Gacha pity system (`f3df3de8`)
PASS – pity counters raise 5★/6★ odds over time.

### Duplicate handling (`6e2558e7`)
FAILED – duplicates only record vitality bonuses; no stack rules or stat application.

### Gacha presentation (`a0f85dbd`)
FAILED – presentation merely stores results; `play_animation` is a no-op and no UI is rendered.

### SQLCipher schema (`798aafd3`)
PASS – migration creates runs and players tables and `SaveManager` enforces key usage.

### Save key management (`428e9823`)
PASS – PBKDF2 key derivation and key file backup/restore provided.

### Migration tooling (`72fc9ac3`)
PASS – versioned scripts run via `PRAGMA user_version`.

### Asset style research (`ad61da93`)
PASS – documents low-poly and pixelated options with CC sources.

### Conversion workflow (`10bd22da`)
PASS – script converts `.obj` or `.blend` to `.bam`/`.egg` with manifest and cache updates.

### Audio system (`7f5c8c36`)
PASS – `AudioManager` plays music and SFX with adjustable volumes backed by `AssetManager`.

## Test results
`uv run pytest` – 63 passed, 6 skipped.

## Summary of nitpicky findings
Boss room code references nonexistent UI, duplicate handling ignores stack rules, gacha presentation is a stub, and several systems lack persistence or polish. Sloppiness remains in cross-module assumptions; future audits will be even harsher.

FAILED
