# Panda3D Subtask Audit

## Summary
- Reviewed checked-off Panda3D subtasks and task order entries.
- Ran full test suite; failures persist from unimplemented plugins.

## Findings
### Project scaffold (`0f95beef`)
- README installation instructions use `uv pip install -U` with the `Ver2` branch instead of the required `uv add git+https://github.com/Midori-AI/Midori-AI-AutoFighter@main`.
- Test suite fails, so scaffold remains unverified.

### Main loop and window handling (`869cac49`)
- ShowBase subclass, scene manager, window title, and input hooks implemented.
- Integration depends on plugin loader, which still reports registration failures.

### Plugin loader (`56f168aa`)
- Discovery registers classes but foes, passives, and room categories are untested.
- Poison DoT is absent and tests report missing plugin registrations.

### Damage and healing migration (`7b715405`)
- Stats dataclass and DoT/HoT implementations cover listed effects with unit tests.
- Legacy test failures are unrelated to this task.

### Main menu and settings (`0d21008f`)
- Main menu and options scenes include required buttons, volume controls, and keyboard navigation.
- No automated coverage for menu behavior.

## Recommendations
- **Coders:** Update README to follow the specified `uv add` installation, expand plugin loader to cover all categories, supply missing plugins, and consider adding menu tests.
- **Reviewers:** Verify plugin registration and installation instructions before approving future work.
