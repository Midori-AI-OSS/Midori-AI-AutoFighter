# Battle Rooms

`BattleRoom` hosts turn-based encounters against scaled foes. It handles attack rolls, damage display, and overtime warnings after long fights.

`BossRoom` extends this scene to load boss-specific models, music, and scripted attack patterns. Boss configurations live in `autofighter.rooms.boss_patterns` and expose reward data after victory.
