# Gacha system

## Presentation flow
- Determine the highest rarity in the pull results.
- Play the video or animation for that rarity unless the player skips.
- After the animation (or immediately if skipped), show a results menu.
  - Single pulls show one item.
  - Multi pulls list all items.
- Allow skipping at any point to jump directly to the results menu.
