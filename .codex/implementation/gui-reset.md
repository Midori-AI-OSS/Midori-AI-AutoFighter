# GUI Reset

The legacy `game/ui` package was removed to restart the interface from a clean slate. All future GUI work must follow the [Panda3D GUI manual](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/gui/index) and remain under `aspect2d`.

Developers should download and review the manual before touching any GUI code. Do not commit downloaded documentation to the repository.
