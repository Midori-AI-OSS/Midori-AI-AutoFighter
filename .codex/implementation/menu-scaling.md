# Menu Scaling Helper

Menus now scale against a base resolution of 1280Ã—720. A constant scale
factor keeps widgets the same physical size regardless of window
dimensions so layouts remain stable for testing. The window is locked to a
16:9 resolution to prevent janky resizing. Background images pull from
`assets/textures/backgrounds/` with a white fallback when an image is
missing.

## Testing
- `uv run pytest`
