# Party Picker

Selecting **New Run** now presents a party picker before the map. It
lists only the player's owned character plugins with their
`CharacterType` and lets players choose up to four allies in addition to
the main character. The selection persists into the run and is passed to
`RunMap` and `BattleRoom` for future use.
