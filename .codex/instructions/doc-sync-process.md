# Documentation sync process

Keep player and foe documentation aligned with code changes.

- Update `README.md` whenever the player roster or enemy generation rules change.
- Mirror those updates in `.codex/implementation/player-foe-reference.md`.
- Include details on new modifiers or abilities so other contributors can reference them.
- Pull requests should confirm that these docs were refreshed and link or update relevant `.codex/tasks` entries.
