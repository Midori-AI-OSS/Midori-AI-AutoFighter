# Player Creator

The Player Creator scene lets users customise their fighter before starting a run.

## Appearance
- Choose a body style: Athletic, Slim, or Heavy
- Choose a hair style: Short, Long, or Ponytail
- Pick a hair color: Black, Blonde, or Red
- Select an accessory: None, Hat, or Glasses

## Stats
Distribute 100 points across HP, Attack, and Defense using sliders. Spending 100 of each damage type's 4â˜… upgrade items grants one extra point. Optional bonuses from starter items are added when confirming the selection.

## Saving
Confirming writes the chosen appearance and stats to `player.json`, which is loaded when starting a new run.

## Layout
Widget positions are expressed as fractional offsets of the window size via
`bind_responsive` in `autofighter.gui`. When adding new controls, use this helper
to keep labels and sliders aligned as the window resizes.
