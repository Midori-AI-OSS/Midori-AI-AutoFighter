# Rest Room

Describes the rest room scene.

- Offers gacha pulls or party swapping without advancing the run.
- Uses are limited per floor; options disable after the allowance is spent.
- At least two Rest Rooms must spawn on each floor, enforced via
  `RestRoom.should_spawn`.
- Escape returns to the previous scene.
