# Card Design

Parent: [Panda3D Game Remake Planning](8a7d9c1e-panda3d-game-plan.md)

## Guiding Principles
- Cards are unique rewards with a single copy each.
- Strength scales by star rank: 1★ offers tiny bonuses, while 5★ radically changes how battles play out.

## 1★ Cards
- **Micro Blade** – +3% ATK.
- **Polished Shield** – +3% DEF.
- **Sturdy Vest** – +3% HP.
- **Lucky Coin** – +3% Crit Rate.
- **Sharpening Stone** – +3% Crit Damage.
- **Mindful Tassel** – +3% Effect Hit Rate.
- **Calm Beads** – +3% Effect Res.
- **Energizing Tea** – +3% Energy Regeneration.
- **Thick Skin** – +3% Bleed Resist.
- **Balanced Diet** – +3% HP & +3% DEF.

## 2★ Cards
- **Critical Focus** – Grants +55% ATK. At the start of each ally's turn they gain 1 stack of *Critical Boost*. *Critical Boost* stacks indefinitely, granting +0.5% Crit Rate and +5% Crit Damage per stack but vanishes when the unit is hit.
- **Critical Transfer** – When an ally uses their Ultimate, they inherit all *Critical Boost* stacks and gain +4% ATK per stack for that turn.
- **Iron Guard** – +55% DEF; whenever an ally takes damage, all allies gain +10% DEF for 1 turn, stacking endlessly.
- **Swift Footwork** – Allies take +1 action per turn; their first action each combat costs 0 Energy.
- **Mystic Aegis** – +55% Effect Res; upon resisting a debuff, heal 5% Max HP.
- **Vital Surge** – +55% Max HP; while below 50% HP, gain +55% ATK.
- **Elemental Spark** – +55% ATK & +55% Effect Hit Rate; all debuffs a random ally applies gain +5% potency.

## 3★ Cards
- **Critical Overdrive** – While an ally has *Critical Boost*, their Crit Rate increases by 10%. Every 1% of excess Crit Rate converts to +2% Crit Damage. Grants +255% ATK.
- **Iron Resurgence** – +200% DEF & +200% HP; the first time an ally dies, revive them with 10% HP. Effect recharges every 4 turns.
- **Arc Lightning** – +255% ATK; every attack chains 50% damage to a random foe.

## 4★ Cards
- **Overclock** – +240% ATK & +240% Effect Hit Rate; at the start of each battle, all allies immediately take two actions back to back.
- **Iron Resolve** – +240% DEF & +240% HP; the first time an ally dies, revive them at 30% HP. This effect refreshes every 3 turns.
- **Arcane Repeater** – +240% ATK; each attack has a 30% chance to immediately repeat at 50% power.

## 5★ Cards
- **Phantom Ally** – +1500% ATK; on the first turn, summon a temporary copy of a random ally to fight for you.
- **Temporal Shield** – +3000% DEF & +3000% HP; each turn has a 50% chance to grant 99% damage reduction for that turn.
- **Reality Split** – +1500% ATK; at the start of each turn, a random ally gains +50% Crit Rate and their attacks leave an After Image that echoes 25% of the damage to all foes.
