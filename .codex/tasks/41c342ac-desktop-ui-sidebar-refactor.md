# Simplify desktop layout to a single viewport

## Summary
Remove the party viewer and target stats panel and let the game viewport occupy roughly 95% of the screen.

## Tasks
- Strip out left-side party and target stat windows.
- Expand the game viewport to about 95% of the available screen space.

## Context
Current frontend anticipated side windows that are no longer desired.

## Notes
Keep existing menu behavior and stained-glass sidebar.

## Outcome
Desktop mode now shows a large game viewport using about 95% of the screen without auxiliary windows, while menus remain accessible from the sidebar.
