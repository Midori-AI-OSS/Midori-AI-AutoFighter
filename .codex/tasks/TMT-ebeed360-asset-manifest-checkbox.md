# Update asset manifest checkbox

## Summary
`assets.toml` exists but `.codex/tasks/ac8cbde0-panda3d-task-order.md` still shows the manifest creation step unchecked.

## Tasks
- [ ] Mark "Create an `assets.toml` mapping logical keys to file paths and hashes" as complete in `.codex/tasks/ac8cbde0-panda3d-task-order.md`.

## Context
Ensures task list reflects current repository state so future contributors don't redo completed work.
