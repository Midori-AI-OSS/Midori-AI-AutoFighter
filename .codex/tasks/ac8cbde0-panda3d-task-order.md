# Panda3D Remake Task Order

## Summary
Define the execution order for Panda3D remake subtasks based on the existing task list and planning document.
Review `.codex/planning/8a7d9c1e-panda3d-game-plan.md` before starting or auditing any step.

Coders must check in with the reviewer or task master before marking tasks complete.
