# Web Rewrite Task Order

## Summary
Ordered steps for moving Midori AI AutoFighter to a Svelte frontend and a Python Quart backend. Tasks now reflect pronoun limits, damage-type rules, and rest-node gacha access. Reminder: list only task titles and file namesâ€”open each task file for details. (ready for audit)

- Read `.codex/planning/8a7d9c1e-web-game-plan.md` before starting or auditing any task.
- Coordinate with the reviewer or Task Master before marking a task complete.
- Keep `myunderstanding.md` up to date with the game's flow.

## Context
Switching from Panda3D to a web-based GUI with a Quart backend managed via Docker Compose.

## Task Master Notes
- Persistent save database is intentionally omitted; do not ship `save.db` or add a volume.
- `Dockerfile.python` chains `yay` commands with `&&`; this is required and needs no further task.
- Compose profiles should continue sharing host port `59002` to prevent simultaneous use.
