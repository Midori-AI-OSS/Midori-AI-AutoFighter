# Stat Allocation

## Summary
Implement a 100-point pool system where each point grants +1% to a chosen stat.

## Tasks
- [ ] Provide UI for distributing points among core stats.
- [ ] Clamp allocations to remaining points and enforce the +1% rule.
- [ ] Display remaining points and prevent confirmation until all are spent or saved.
- [ ] Document this feature in `.codex/implementation`.
- [ ] Add unit tests covering success and failure cases.

## Context
Proper stat allocation lets players tailor builds before a run.

## Testing
- [ ] Run `uv run pytest`.

Once complete, update this task with `status: ready for review` and request an auditor to update this status.
