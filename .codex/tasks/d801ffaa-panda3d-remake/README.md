# Panda3D Remake Task List

## Summary
This folder tracks implementation work for migrating the game to a Panda3D-based remake. Each Markdown file describes a single
subtask. Coders should pick one file, follow the instructions, and update the task status when finished.

## How to Use
1. Choose any subtask Markdown file in this folder.
2. Complete the work described under "## Tasks".
3. At the end of the file, add the line `status: ready for review`.
4. Notify an auditor so they can update the status.

## Subtasks
See the individual `*.md` files in this directory for the twenty implementation subtasks.
