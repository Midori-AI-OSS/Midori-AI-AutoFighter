# Fix Map Orientation and Room States

## Summary
The floor map appears upside down and rooms are unclear. The map should orient correctly, highlight the current room, gray out upcoming rooms, and hide rooms already visited.

## Instructions
- Adjust the frontend map rendering so the boss node appears at the top and the start room at the bottom.
- Highlight the current room or provide a start-room label.
- Gray out rooms that are ahead on the path while keeping them visible.
- Remove or hide rooms that have been completed.

## Context
Clarifies navigation and progression during runs.
