# Verify Unified Room Action Route

## Summary
Need a single backend endpoint to handle room actions if specific routes are missing.

## Instructions
- Check backend for existing unified room_action endpoint.
- If absent, design a route that accepts room ID and action type.
- Update docs so frontend knows which endpoint to call.

## Context
Simplifies room selection handling from the map.
