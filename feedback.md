## UI Bug Feedback: Endless Autofighter

This feedback is based on the attached screenshots of the game menus.

### Main Menu
The main menu appears to render correctly, with all buttons and text visible and properly aligned.

### Edit Player Menu (Buggy)
In the Edit Player menu (see second screenshot), the UI is severely broken:
- The interface is excessively zoomed in.
- Text and buttons overlap, making the menu unreadable.
- Layout is distorted, with elements rendered far larger than intended.

### Settings Menu (Buggy)
In the Settings menu (see third screenshot), similar issues are present:
- UI elements are scaled incorrectly.
- Text and buttons overlap and are unreadable.
- The layout is completely broken, with elements stacked on top of each other.

#### Possible Causes
These issues may be related to:
- UI scaling logic
- Font size settings
- Window resizing or DPI handling
