# Gameplay Overview

When I launch the game I'm greeted by a dark, glassy main menu filled with large icons. Curious, I press **New Run** and a roster window slides in so I can browse the characters I've unlocked. I pick up to four allies, feel a little thrill, and confirm my party.

A stylized floor map fades in, showing branching paths of room icons. Hovering over each node tells me whether it's a battle, shop, or rest room, so I plan a route and hit Enter to move.

In battle rooms my team automatically trades blows with the enemy while damage numbers and status icons pop up. Shop rooms display items with prices and star ratings, letting me spend gold or reroll the stock. Rest rooms offer a calm break where I can heal or trade items before heading back to the map.

Clearing room after room eventually brings me to a boss icon. Beating the boss finishes the floor and I return to the map or the main menu. Between runs I can roll the gacha for new characters and tweak my player appearance.
